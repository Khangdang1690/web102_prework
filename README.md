## Notes

There a few challenges that I encountered. Number one is getting used to ternary conditionals. I'm more familiar using if else condition, so using '?' and ':' to make a condition took some time for me to accept it. Furthermore, I got a bit trouble building the search bar, so I have to google to get a guideline of it. I'm also not good at designing, so I have to make the search bar similar to the one that Code Path has on its prework website. That's all.
